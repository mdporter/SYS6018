# Problem 1: Kaggle

You are to make at least one official entry in the [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview) Kaggle contest. 

- You will need to register in Kaggle (its free)
- Read the details of the contest. Understand the data and evaluation function.
- Make at least one submission
- If you get a score on the public leaderboard of $\text{RMSE}<0.50$ (note RMSE is calculated on the log scale), you receive full credit, otherwise, you'll lose 10 points. 
    - I'll allow [teaming](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/team) to achieve the score, but only if everyone on the team produces a model that is used to generate the final submission (e.g., stacking or model averaging)
- Submit the following in Collab:
    - Code
    - kaggle name (or team name) so we can ensure you had a valid submission. 
    - your score and current ranking on the kaggle leaderboard
- Top 5 scores get 2 bonus points
    - Teams will split their bonus points among team members
